# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a C++ project using CMake as the build system. It's currently a simple "Hello World" application that serves as a foundation for experimenting with different C++ features and libraries. The project uses C++23 standard and is designed to be extended with various branch-specific sample implementations.

## Build Commands
**IMPORTANT**: This branch is for testing Claude Code functionality. Building should be done from Visual Studio 2022 - do NOT execute build commands from Claude Code.

- Build is handled by Visual Studio 2022
- Do not run cmake or build commands from the command line

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp` - Entry point with basic Hello World implementation
- `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake configuration file specifying C++23 standard and executable target
- `out/build/` - Build output directory (generated by CMake)

## Development Notes
- The project is configured for C++23 with `CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON`
- CMake minimum version requirement is 3.00
- The target executable name is `CmakeCpp`
- This branch (`test_claude_code`) is specifically for testing Claude Code functionality
- Build operations are handled by Visual Studio 2022, not command line tools

## Architecture
This is a minimal single-file C++ application. The architecture is intentionally simple to serve as a starting point for various C++ experiments and feature demonstrations across different git branches.
