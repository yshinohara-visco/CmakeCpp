# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a C++ project using CMake as the build system with a modular library structure. It demonstrates a math operations library with comprehensive testing using GoogleTest. The project uses C++23 standard and is designed to be extended with various branch-specific sample implementations.

## Build Commands
**IMPORTANT**: Building should be done from Visual Studio 2022 - do NOT execute build commands from Claude Code.

- Build is handled by Visual Studio 2022
- Do not run cmake or build commands from the command line

## Testing Commands
Tests are built using GoogleTest framework with custom CMake helper functions:
- Test target name: `math_operations_test`
- Tests are automatically discovered using `gtest_discover_tests()`
- Test files are in `tests/` directory

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp` - Entry point demonstrating math operations library with exception handling
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Root CMake configuration with C++23 standard and GoogleTest integration
- `math_lib/` - Math operations library module
  - `math_operations.h` - Header with static method declarations
  - `math_operations.cpp` - Implementation file
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - Library build configuration
- `tests/` - GoogleTest unit tests
  - `test_math_operations.cpp` - Comprehensive test suite with boundary value testing
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - Test target configuration using custom helper function
- `cmakes/google_test.cmake` - GoogleTest configuration with FetchContent and helper functions
- `out/build/` - Build output directory (generated by CMake)

## Development Notes
- The project is configured for C++23 with `CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON`
- CMake minimum version requirement is 3.14
- The target executable name is `CmakeCpp`
- GoogleTest is automatically fetched using FetchContent from GitHub releases
- Custom CMake function `create_gtest_target()` simplifies test target creation
- Build operations are handled by Visual Studio 2022, not command line tools

## Architecture
The project follows a modular library design:
- **Math Operations Library**: Static class with basic arithmetic operations and error handling
- **Main Application**: Demonstrates library usage with exception handling for division by zero
- **Testing Layer**: Comprehensive unit tests covering normal cases, boundary values, and error conditions
- **Build System**: CMake with GoogleTest integration and custom helper functions for test management

## Language Settings
- Respond in Japanese when working with this codebase
- Code comments and documentation should be in Japanese as per project conventions
- Variable names and function names should remain in English for compatibility

## File Encoding
- All new files should be created with UTF-8 with BOM encoding for Visual Studio compatibility
- This is especially important for files containing Japanese characters
- Existing files should maintain their current encoding unless specifically requested to change

## Coding Style
- Function names: PascalCase (例: UpdateValue, ReadText)
- Variable names: snake_case (例: new_value, current_data)
- Member variables: snake_case with trailing underscore (例: current_data_, update_mutex_)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (例: MAX_VALUE, DEFAULT_TEXT)
- Class names: PascalCase (例: AsyncData, MathOperations)
